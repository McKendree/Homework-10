# Homework-10 Q1
Run hwk10_p1-McKendreeSpringer.py by executing python hwk10_p1-McKendreeSpringer.py. This will save and print the graph "Leapfrog_Method.png" which is the answer to parts a and b of question 1.

# Homework-10 Q2
Run hwk10_p2-McKendreeSpringer.py by executing python hwk10_p2-McKendreeSpringer.py. This will save and print the graphs "fixed_rk4_orbit.png" and "adaptive_rk4_orbit.png"; and will also print the amount of time each rk4 method took to run, as well as the stepsize for the fixed rk4 method, and the initial stepsize for the adaptive rk4 method. The answer to part a of question 2 is written in the f(r) function, and the answers to part b, c, and d are the printed values and created graphs.
